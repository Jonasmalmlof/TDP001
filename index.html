<p>Just another student, studying Innovative Programming at Linköpings Tekniska Högskola. Pay no mind to the madman behind the curtains. Or the Jester in the rafters. This bit of text is totally not here to make me feel like I didn't just re-work the files in the Portfolio-project we did a few months ago (link up top and to the right)... like strip the pages of the python-code and other more advanced -and honestly quite annoying- features we had for that. No siree. nope.
<p>Honestly though. I had a bit of fun with it. It works and looks good, so what's the harm?
<p>Also... why am I writing this in English?
